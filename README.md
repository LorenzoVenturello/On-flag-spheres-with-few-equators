# On-flag-spheres-with-few-equators

This repository contains the file Irreducible_flag_3-spheres.sage with the list of facets of few flag simplicial 3-spheres with the following properties:
- They are not suspensions
- There is no edge that can be contracted to obtain another flag sphere
- The unique induced equators (subcomplexes which are spheres of codimension 1) are the links of vertices

They play a role in the study of face numbers of flag spheres, and their existence was asked in Problem 1.5 of the following article
Maria Chudnovsky and Eran Nevo, Induced equators in flag spheres, Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series A, 176, 105283, 2020, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcta.2020.105283.

In the file Equators_check.sage we also include a function to check whether all the induced equators are links of vertices.
